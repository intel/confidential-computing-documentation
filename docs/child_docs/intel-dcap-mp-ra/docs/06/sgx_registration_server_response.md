# SGX Registration Server Response

This variable is created by software when it successfully receives response data from the registration authority service.
Once successfully completed, the software sets the `SgxRegistrationStatus.SgxRegistrationComplete` bit to 1 to indicate to BIOS that the software does not require the same SGX Registration Server Request data on the subsequent boot flow.
Currently, the only response data from the registration authority service platform membership certificates in response to a successful add request.

You should clear the data in this variable once it is consumed by BIOS to protect privacy sensitive data on the next boot.
