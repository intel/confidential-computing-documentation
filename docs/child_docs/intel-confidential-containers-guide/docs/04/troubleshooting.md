# Troubleshooting

This section provides instructions on troubleshooting common issues that may arise during the deployment of workload applications in a Kubernetes cluster, protected with Intel TDX and verified using attestation.


## Pods Failed to Start

This section provides guidance on how to resolve the issue when pods fail to start due to missing parent snapshot.
Such a problem might occur when containerd's plugin (Nydus Snapshotter) failed to clean the images correctly.

To see if your pod is affected by this issue, run the following command:

``` { .bash }
kubectl describe pod nginx-td-attestation
```

An error with containerd's plugin (Nydus Snapshotter) will be indicated by the following error message:

``` { .text }
failed to create containerd container: create snapshot: missing parent \"k8s.io/2/sha256:961e...\" bucket: not found
```

To resolve the issue, try the following procedure:

- Uninstall Confidential Containers Operator as described in the [uninstall Confidential Containers Operator](../02/infrastructure_setup.md#uninstall-confidential-containers-operator) section.
- Remove all data collected by containerd's plugin (Nydus Snapshotter):

    ``` { .bash }
    sudo ctr -n k8s.io images rm $(sudo ctr -n k8s.io images ls -q)
    sudo ctr -n k8s.io content rm $(sudo ctr -n k8s.io content ls -q)
    sudo ctr -n k8s.io snapshots rm $(sudo ctr -n k8s.io snapshots ls | awk 'NR>1 {print $1}')
    ```

- Re-install Confidential Containers Operator using the instructions provided in the [install Confidential Containers Operator](../02/infrastructure_setup.md#install-confidential-containers-operator) section.
- Re-deploy your workloads.


## Attestation Failure

This section pinpoints the most common reasons for attestation failure and provides guidance on how to resolve them.
An attestation failure is indicated by the fact that pod is in `Init:Error` state and `ATTESTATION FAILED` message is present in the logs of the pod.

!!! note
    The example outputs presented in the following might differ from your output, because of different names of the pods/deployments or different IP addresses.

To identify if you encounter an attestation failure, follow the steps below:

- Retrieve the status of the `nginx-td-attestation` pod:

    ``` { .bash }
    kubectl get pods
    ```

    Sample output with nginx-td-attestation pod is in `Init:Error` state:

    ``` { .text }
    NAME                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    nginx-td-attestation   0/1     Init:Error   0          1m
    ```

- Get the logs of the `init-attestation` container in the `nginx-td-attestation` pod:

    ``` { .bash }
    kubectl logs pod/nginx-td-attestation -c init-attestation
    ```

    Sample output indicating the `ATTESTATION FAILED` message:

    ``` { .text }
    NAME                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    starting
    (...)
    ATTESTATION FAILED
    ```

In case of attestation failure, follow the steps below to troubleshoot the issue:

- Check if the IntelÂ® Trust Authority API key is correct and KBS was deployed with this value:

    ``` { .bash }
    kubectl describe configmap kbs-config -n coco-tenant | grep -i api_key
    ```

    Expected output:

    ``` { .text }
    api_key = "<YOUR_ITA_API_KEY>"
    ```

- Check if the KBS pod is running and accessible:

    ``` { .bash }
    echo $(kubectl get nodes -o jsonpath='{.items[0].status.addresses[0].address}'):$(kubectl get svc kbs -n coco-tenant -o jsonpath='{.spec.ports[0].nodePort}')
    ```

    Expected output:

    ``` { .text }
    <protocol>://<address>:<port>
    ```

- Check KBS logs for any errors:

    ``` { .bash }
    kubectl logs pod/kbs-85b8548d76-k7pcj -n coco-tenant
    ```

    An `HTTP 400 Bad Request` error might suggest that platform is not registered correctly.
    Refer to the [platform registration](../../../intel-tdx-enabling-guide/02/infrastructure_setup/#platform-registration) section of the Intel TDX Enabling Guide for details.

- Check for errors in Intel PCCS service:

    ``` { .bash }
    systemctl status pccs
    ```

    Use the following command to get more logs:

    ``` { .bash }
    sudo journalctl -u pccs
    ```

- Check for errors in Intel TDX Quote Generation Service:

    ``` { .bash }
    systemctl status qgsd
    ```

    Use the following command to get more logs:

    ``` { .bash }
    sudo journalctl -u qgsd
    ```

    The following error occurs if the platform is not registered correctly.

    ``` { .text }
    [QPL] No certificate data for this platform.
    ```

    Refer to the [platform registration](../../../intel-tdx-enabling-guide/02/infrastructure_setup/#platform-registration) section of the Intel TDX Enabling Guide for details.
