# Overview

Welcome to Intel's Confidential Computing documentation page, which offers insights into Intel's leading-edge solutions helping to safeguard sensitive data in use.
Intel® Confidential Computing technologies are designed to enable a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) where data can be processed securely, even in potentially untrusted environments such as public clouds.
By combining hardware-based security with cutting-edge software solutions, Intel empowers businesses to help protect their most critical assets, make compliance easier, and enhance control over data—enabling innovation while reducing risk.

This documentation serves as a hub for developers, IT administrators, and decision-makers seeking to understand, implement, and leverage Intel's technologies for Confidential Computing.
Key offerings such as Intel® Software Guard Extensions (Intel® SGX) and Intel® Trust Domain Extensions (Intel® TDX) are covered in detail, with guidance on how to use these technologies to setup Trusted Execution Environments.

We welcome contributions to our documentation from the community to help improve and expand it for Intel's Confidential Computing offerings.
Whether you're an experienced user or new to the technology, your feedback, corrections, and additional content can help enhance the overall quality and usability of this resource.
Detailed instructions on how to contribute, including guidelines for submitting changes or adding new content, can be found on our GitHub repository at [github.com/intel/confidential-computing-documentation/](https://github.com/intel/confidential-computing-documentation/).
